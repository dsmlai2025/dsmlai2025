# [3_Growth_Product_Manager](#3_Growth_Product_Manager)
NanoDegree Course Details: https://www.udacity.com/course/monetization-strategy--nd037-3

**Project:** In this project I built a monetization model for a post-revenue B2B SaaS business, and then modify it for a different pricing scheme.
I was provided with a description of the company, its product, pricing scheme, and a dataset of recent months' activity. 
Based on this model, I came up with product improvements that can improve monetization KPIs as well as suggest a change to the pricing scheme. Finally I modified the original models to accommodate a given modified pricing scheme.

1. Build a monetization model for a post-revenue B2B SaaS business, and then come up with hypotheses about potential changes to the monetization strategy. 
2. Build monetization models based on the company, its product, pricing scheme, and a dataset of recent customer transactions.
3. Identify and create hypotheses about changing the pricing metric and pricing plans to optimize the business’ monetization strategy.
4. Experimentation plan to test these hypotheses.

Monetization Business Models | 
1. Acquisition
2. Unit Economics
3. Customer Accounting
4. Revenue Accounting
5. Growth Ratios
